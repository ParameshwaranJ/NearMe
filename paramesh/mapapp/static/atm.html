        <h3>An ATM, or Automated Teller Machine, is an electronic banking device that allows customers to perform financial transactions like cash withdrawals, deposits, and balance inquiries without a human teller. These machines are accessible 24/7 in public places, making banking more convenient and offering self-service options like fund transfers and bill payments through the use of a debit card and PIN. </h3>
