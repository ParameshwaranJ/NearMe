        <h3>The Taluk office is a key administrative body in India, functioning as the local government office at the sub-district level, often also referred to as a Tehsil office. It is headed by an official known as the Tahsildar (or Talukdar/Mamledar in some states), who functions as the executive magistrate for that area. </h3>
